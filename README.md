👋 Hey, I'm Jorge—a full-stack developer who loves building fast, efficient, and user-friendly progressive web apps with Go, HTMX, and Web Components. I’m all about doing good by being good.

🛠️ When I’m in dev mode, I focus on clean code, great developer experience, and performance-driven solutions.

🍽️ Currently working on Nonna’s Secret, a social recipe app where users can discover, share, and personalize recipes while connecting with a like-minded community. Built to make cooking easier and more enjoyable, it blends modern web technologies with an intuitive user experience.

💡 Passionate about progressive web apps, SSR-first architectures, and developer-friendly tooling—because great software should be a joy to build and use.

🚀 Open to remote and in-house opportunities in the US and/or the EU, especially if it involves practical innovation and positive impact.

📫 Let’s build something awesome!
